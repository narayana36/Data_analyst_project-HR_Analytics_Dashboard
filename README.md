## KPI's Requriment

#### The HR department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure the organization maintains a healthy workforce. However, there is a lack of clear performance indicators to track and anlyze key HR metrics. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement a set of KPIs to address the following points:

### 1. Employee Count:
 The HR department lacks visibilty into the total number of employees, making it challenging to assess workforce size and plan for future growth or downizing effiectively.
### 2. Attrition Count:
 The oragnization lacks a standardized method to track employee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employee who have left the organization.
 ### 3.Attrition Rate:
  Without a clear measure of attrition rate, the oragnization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarks, hindering the ability to gauage employee satisfaction and engagement.
 ### 4.Active Employees:
  The oragnization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately the current workforce's productivity and capacity.
  ### 5. Average Age:
   The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees, making it difficult to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and retain younger talent.
## Chart's Requirement 
### Attrition by Gender:
  The HR department faces challenges in understanding the attrition patterns based on gender, making it difficult to identify any gender-related disparties and implement targeted retention strategies.
### Department-wise Attrition:
  The HR department lacks visualizations to showcase attrition rates across different departments. This hinders their ability to identify departments with higher attrition rates and address any underlying issues or concerns effiectively.
### Number of Employees by Age Group:
  The HR department requires visual representations to anlyze the distribution of employees across various age groups. This help in assessing workforce demographics, identifying any age-related gaps or imbalances, and implementing targeted HR policies or programs.
### Job Satisfaction Ratings:
  The HR department lacks visualization to represent job statisfaction ratings, hindering their ability to measure employee engagement and overall job statisfaction levels effectively.
### Education Field-wise Attrition:
  The HR departemnt requires visual reprentations to analyze attrition rates based on education fields. This helps identify specific educational background that may be associated with higer attrition, enabling the organization to tailor retenation strategies accordingly.
### Attrtion Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups:
The HR department lacks visualizations that display attrition rates based on gender and different age groups. This makes it challenging to identify any age and gender-related attrition trends, preventing the organization from implementing targeting retention strategies for specific employee segaments
